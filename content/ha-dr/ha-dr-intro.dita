 <title>High availability and disaster recovery</title>
 <shortdesc>Couchbase Server supports a range of high availability and disaster recovery (HA/DR)
  strategies depending on an organizationâ€™s needs, standard operating procedures, and budget. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p>Although Couchbase Server supports true zero downtime deployments, often less stringent
   downtime objectives can be supported more economically and without serious impact to business
   continuity for mission critical applications. The exact tools and configurations to use depend on
   an organization's recovery point objectives (RPO = how much data can be lost in case of failure?)
   and recovery time objectives (RTO = how long does the technical team have to restore the system
   and the data?). Most HA/DR strategies rely on a multi-pronged approach of maximizing
   availability, increasing redundancy within and across data centers, and performing regular
   backups.</p>
