  <title>What's New in Version 4.5?</title>
  <body>
    <p>Couchbase Server 4.5 builds on the advances of version 4 with faster, simpler, and more
      secure data processing. The new features include memory-optimized global indexes, indexing of
      embedded arrays, the ability to make partial updates to a document, a Query Workbench in the
      Web Console, flexible JOINS with N1QL, and a new, resilient enterprise backup and restore.
        <note type="important">This is a Developer Preview version of Couchbase Server 4.5 and is
        intended for development purposes only. We consider Developer Preview releases to have some
        rough edges and bugs, and may change significantly before the final GA release. This release
        is <b>not supported</b> in production. <p>The Developer Preview release does <b>not
            support</b> upgrading from an earlier version of Couchbase Server.</p></note></p>
    <section><title>Faster</title>
      <p>Couchbase Server version 4.5 enables faster queries with memory-optimized global indexes
        and array indexing. These, along with the features added in version 4.1 such as prepared
        execution of N1QL statements and covering indexes, give querying and indexing a significant
        boost.</p>

          <dt>Memory-Optimized Global Indexes</dt>
          <dd>Version 4 of Couchbase Server introduced <xref href="http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.1/architecture/global-secondary-indexes.html"
              format="html" scope="external">global indexes</xref> which are <xref href="http://developer.couchbase.com/documentation/server/4.1/architecture/services-archi-multi-dimensional-scaling.html"
              format="html" scope="external"> independently partitioned</xref> away from data for
            faster N1QL queries. Couchbase Server 4.5 provides additional tuning for index
            processing and index scans. The new memory-optimized indexing provide a fresher index
            under heavy mutation rates (INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE) and powers lower latency queries.
            Unlike other databases, Couchbase Server global indexes are built to isolate impact of
            indexing on performance of mutations, data ingest, and bulk data modifications using
            N1QL INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE and MERGE statements. Couchbase Server 4.5 memory-optimized
            indexes further enhances index processing and isolation of impact of indexing on the
            incoming workload. <p>You can enable the new memory-optimized global indexes through the index settings under the <uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol> tab in the Couchbase Server Web Console. For more information, see <xref href="../architecture/in-memory-indexes.dita"/>.</p></dd></dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Array Indexing</dt>
            <dd>N1QL provides a considerable number of verbs to process embedded structures and
            arrays such as <codeph>UNNEST</codeph> and <codeph>ANY</codeph>/<codeph>EVERY</codeph>
            operators. With the new array indexing feature, developers can optimize the execution of
            the queries. The new index can optimize queries that are looking for specific arrays.
            Arrays are indexed using the new DISTINCT ARRAY keyword in <xref
              href="../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/createindex.dita">CREATE INDEX statement</xref> in N1QL. For more information, see <xref href="../n1ql/n1ql-language-reference/indexing-arrays.dita"/>. </dd>

          <dd>Tunable consistency for N1QL and MapReduce queries helps improve the query performance. With version 4.5,  </dd>
        </dlentry>-->
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Improved Index Write Performance with Circular Compaction</dt>
          <dd>Global indexes use the new ForestDB engine for index storage. ForestDB uses an append-only architecture where full compaction is run as and when pages are orphaned with the appending writes. With version 4.5, ForestDB introduces circular compaction as an alternative to full compaction. Circular compaction reduces the disk size and IO bandwidth demands for indexes and reduces the requirement to run frequent full compaction operations. This improves the overall index maintenance and index read and write performance greatly for global indexes. Circular compaction is enabled by default. You can change the compaction settings from the <menucascade><uicontrol>Settings</uicontrol> <uicontrol>Auto-Compaction</uicontrol></menucascade> tab on the Web Console. See here for more information. </dd>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>Flexible Commutative JOIN in N1QL</dt>
          <dd>With version 4.5, N1QL introduces an extended <codeph>JOIN</codeph> syntax for added
            flexibility in JOINs. The new <codeph>JOIN ON KEY</codeph> … <codeph>FOR</codeph>
            keyword allows developers to specify JOIN operations that can use the left or the right
            keyspace for the JOIN. With the extended syntax, N1QL also makes better use of indexes
            to perform the JOIN operation faster across the two sides, and substantially lowers JOIN
            latencies. For example: <codeblock>SELECT * FROM Playlists JOIN Songs ON KEY</codeblock>

          <dt>Advanced Partial Updates and Data Structures</dt>
          <dd>With Couchbase Server 4.5, applications no longer have to address the entire document.
            With the extended APIs, developers can operate on parts of a document without having to
            send the entire document back and forth between client and server. The result is
            enhanced performance and efficiency in the network IO path, especially when documents in
            the system are large. For more information, see <!--<xref href="sub-doc-api.dita"></xref>-->. </dd>

          <dt>Integrated Query Workbench</dt>
          <dd>Couchbase Server 4.5 also provides a simple and visual way to develop and design
            queries with auto-complete for your N1QL statements. Query Workbench analyzes your
            bucket data to infer schemas of your document data and allows the execution of ad hoc
            queries directly from the Web Console. Query results are displayed in JSON, table, and
            tree formats, and can be saved. To use the new integrated Query Workbench, switch to the
            new <uicontrol>Query</uicontrol> tab in the Couchbase Server Web Console. For more

          <dt>Query Monitoring</dt>
          <dd>In Couchbase Server 4.5, N1QL adds several new keyspaces under the
              “<filepath>system:</filepath>” namespace to the existing list that provides
            information on indexes, buckets, and more. The new keyspaces under
              “<filepath>system:</filepath>" allow monitoring active requests, completed requests,
            system information and more. For a full list of new system keyspaces added to N1QL, see

          <dd>In previous releases, the <cmdname>cbq</cmdname> command line tool has been the
            central point for executing N1QL queries. Command line access to N1QL has been greatly
            improved in this release, and the new command line access provides smart connection
            management and full scriptability with version 4.5. For more information, see <!--<xref href="../developer-guide/cbq-shell.dita"></xref>-->.</dd>

            high-performance backup and restore tool allows Couchbase Server to provide faster and
            more scalable recovery options to better integrate with Disaster Recovery planning. See

      <p>Security continues to be a strong priority for Couchbase Server development. Previous
        versions have added many <xref
          href="../security/security-intro.dita">security-related features</xref>, and the 4.5 Developer
        Preview continues by adding support for X.509 certificates. </p>

          <dd>With Couchbase Server 4.5, you can now integrate your signed certificate authority
            within Couchbase Server. X.509 certificates provide strongly trusted, on-the-wire
            encryption for client-server communication and across data centers. The new capability
            also makes it simple for administrators to manage and rotate certificates without
            application downtime. You can find detailed information about X.509 certificates <xref
