  Initialize the Cluster
</title>
  
<shortdesc>
  Following installation, the Couchbase cluster must be <i>initialized</i>. You can achieve this
  by means of the any of the following utilities: the <i>Couchbase Web Console</i>; the Couchbase <i>Command Line Interface</i>; or the
  Couchbase <i>REST API</i>. Instructions for each are provided in this section.

    Access the Couchbase Web Console
  </title>
  
  <p id="couchbase-port-access-info">
    The Couchbase Web Console is, by default, available on port 8091. Therefore, 
    if your machine can be identified on the network as <codeph>servera</codeph>, you can access the Couchbase Web Console by 
    opening <codeph>http://servera:8091/</codeph>. Alternatively, you can use an IP address or, if you are working on the machine
    on which installation was performed, <codeph>http://localhost:8091</codeph>. 
    If you have chosen to run Couchbase on a port other than <codeph>8091</codeph>, connect on that specific port.
  </p>
     
  <p>
    Once you have connected, to begin setting up Couchbase Server, click the
    <uicontrol>Setup</uicontrol> button on the <uicontrol>Welcome Screen</uicontrol>:
  </p>
        
  <p>
    <image href="../admin/picts/welcome.png" id="welcome" align="left" width="320"/>
  </p>
        
  <p>
    The <uicontrol>Welcome Screen</uicontrol> lets you 
    choose either to <uicontrol>Setup New Cluster</uicontrol>, or 
    to <uicontrol>Join Existing Cluster</uicontrol>. Left-click on 
    <uicontrol>Setup New Cluster</uicontrol>. This brings up the
    <uicontrol>New Cluster</uicontrol> screen.

      The <uicontrol>New Cluster</uicontrol> screen appears as follows: 
    </p>
          
    <p>
      <image href="../admin/picts/setUpNewCluster01.png" id="set_up_new_cluster_01" align="left" width="390"/>
    </p>
          
    <p>
      The displayed fields for <uicontrol>New Cluster</uicontrol> are as follows:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <uicontrol>Cluster Name</uicontrol>: An administrator-chosen name for the cluster to
        be created. 
        
        <p>
          <!-- Vertical Space -->
        </p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <uicontrol>Create Admin Username</uicontrol>: An administrator-chosen username, for the
        <i>Full Administrator</i> (which is to say, the current administrator) for this cluster.
        You will have read-write access to all Couchbase Server resources; including the ability
        to create new users with defined roles and corresponding privileges.
        
        <p>
          Note that Couchbase Server prohibits use of the following characters
          in usernames: <codeph>( ) &lt; &gt; @ , ; : \ " / [ ]  ? = { }</codeph>.
        </p>
      </li>
      
      <!-- Note that a proper link to the command referenced below is required when the command
           is defined and added.
        -->
      
      <li>
        An administrator-chosen password, for the Full Administrator on this cluster. This
        only default requirement is that the password be at least 6 characters in length.
        Note that the default password-policy can be modified (and indeed, strengthened), by
        means of the Couchbase CLI <codeph>setting-password-policy</codeph> command.

    <p>
      The content of the <uicontrol>New Cluster</uicontrol> screen now changes, to
      show the <uicontrol>Terms and Conditions</uicontrol> for the Enterprise Edition
      of Couchbase Server:

    <p>
      <image href="../admin/picts/TsAndCs01.png" id="ts_and_cs_01" align="left" width="390"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Check the <uicontrol>I accept the terms &amp; conditions</uicontrol> checkbox. Then, to
      register for updates, left-click on the right-facing arrowhead, adjacent to the
      <uicontrol>Register for updates</uicontrol> notification. The screen now expands
      vertically, as follows:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <image href="../admin/picts/registerForUpdates01.png" id="register_for_updates" align="left" width="390"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To receive updates, fill out the four new fields as appropriate. If you elect to do so,
      provided that the current node is connected to the internet, the Couchbase Server
      version-numbers corresponding to each node in your cluster will be
      anonymously sent to Couchbase: this information is used by Couchbase over time, to provide you with appropriate
      updates, and to help with product-improvement. Your 
      email-address will be added to the Couchbase community mailing-list, so that you can
      periodically receive Couchbase news and product-information. (You can unsubscribe from the
      mailing-list at any time using the <codeph>Unsubscribe</codeph> link, provided in each
      newsletter.)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You now have two options for proceeding. If you left-click on the <uicontrol>Finish With Defaults</uicontrol>
      button, cluster-initialization is performed with default settings, provided by Couchbase. If you
      wish to configure those settings, left-click on the
      <uicontrol>Configure Disk, Memory, Services</uicontrol> button. This brings up the
      <uicontrol>Configure</uicontrol> screen, as described below.

      The fields are described below:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
      <li>
        <uicontrol>Host Name / IP Address</uicontrol>: the hostname or IP address for the machine on which
        you are configuring Couchbase Server.

      <li>
        <uicontrol>Data Disk Path</uicontrol>: The interactive text-field should contain the location 
        on the current node where the database files will be stored. The following
        default is provided: <codeph>/Users/<varname>username</varname>/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data</codeph>. The 
        read-only <uicontrol>Free</uicontrol> field shows the
        current amount of free space for this location.
        <p>
          <!-- Vertical space -->
        </p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <uicontrol>Indexes Disk Path</uicontrol>: The interactive text-field should contain the location 
        on the current node where indices will be stored. The following
        default is provided: <codeph>/Users/<varname>username</varname>/Library/Application Support/Couchbase/var/lib/couchbase/data</codeph>.
        The read-only <uicontrol>Free</uicontrol> field shows the current amount of free space for this location.

        <p>
          Note that for a production environment, it is recommended that data and indexes should <i>not</i> share the same location.
        </p>
        
      </li>
      
      <li>
        <uicontrol>Couchase Memory Quotas</uicontrol>: A series of fields that allows you to specify how much
        memory should be allocated to each service you select for both the current node and for each
        node you may subsequently add to the cluster. Each service can be selected
        by means of checking a checkbox, and then specifying the total number of megabytes to be assigned to it.
        In each case, a memory quota is suggested, and a minimum quota is required. The sum of all quotas
        must be within the total amount of available RAM for the current node.
        
        <p>
          <!-- Vertical space -->

        <ul>
          <li>
            <uicontrol>Data Service (data &amp; views)</uicontrol>: Since you are starting 
            a new cluster, 
            the Data service (which is essential for the cluster)
            has been allocated with its checkbox disabled. If this is a development system, you
            may add up to three services. Note that on a production
            system, it is recommended that only <i>one</i> service ever be 
            allocated per node.
            <p>
              <!-- Vertical space -->
            </p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <uicontrol>GSI Service</uicontrol>: Selection and RAM-allocation for GSI Service. This should be 256 MB or more. 
            If this service is selected, a default quota is provided.
            <p>
              <!-- Vertical space -->
            </p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <uicontrol>FTS Service </uicontrol>: Selection and RAM-allocation for the Full Text Service. This should be 256 MB or more. If this service is selected, a 
            default quota is provided.
            <p>
              <!-- Vertical space -->
            </p>
          </li>
          
          <li>
            <uicontrol>Query Service </uicontrol>: Note that no RAM-allocation is required for the
            Query Service. 
            <p>
              <!-- Vertical space -->
            </p>

        </ul>
        
        <p>
          The total memory quota you have allocated is displayed below these fields, towards the right. The total
          RAM available is displayed below this figure, at the center. If your
          memory allocation is excessive, a notification warns you, and you must re-allocate.
        </p>
      </li>
      
        
      <li>
        <uicontrol>Index Storage Setting</uicontrol>: If the Index service has been selected, either <uicontrol>Standard Global Secondary Indexes</uicontrol> 
        or <uicontrol>Memory-Optimized Global Secondary Indexes</uicontrol> can be chosen here, by means of radio buttons. See 
        <xref href="../architecture/global-secondary-indexes.dita#concept_e5c_kf4_vs"/>, for details.
        <p>
          <!-- Vertical space -->
        </p>
      </li>
      
      <li>
        Check the checkbox for <uicontrol>Enable software update notifications in the web console</uicontrol>, if
        appropriate.
      </li>
      
    </ul>
    
    <p>
      When you are finished entering your configuration-details, left-click on the <uicontrol>Save &amp; Finish</uicontrol>
      button, at the lower right. This configures the server accordingly, and brings up the Couchbase Web Console
      <uicontrol>Dashboard</uicontrol>, for the first time.

      Join an Existing Cluster

      <p>
        If you left-click on <uicontrol>Join Existing Clouster</uicontrol>, the 
        <uicontrol>Join Cluster</uicontrol> screen appears:
      </p>
      
      <p>
        <image href="../admin/picts/joinClusterInitial.png" id="join_cluster_initial" align="left" width="390"/>
      </p>
    
    <p>
      The fields <uicontrol>Cluster Host Name/IP Address</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>Cluster Admin Username</uicontrol>,
      and <uicontrol>Cluster Admin Password</uicontrol> require information defined by the Full Administrator
      for the cluster-host: see
      <xref href="#set-up-a-new-cluster" scope="local" format="dita">Set Up a New Cluster</xref>, above.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      When you have entered the appropriate details, you can left-click on the 
      <uicontrol>Join With Default Configuration</uicontrol> button, at the lower right, in order
      to join the cluster with a default configuration. Note that the default configuration
      is not recommended for production environments.To change that configuration, or to
      review its details, left-click on the right-pointing arrowhead adjacent to the
      <uicontrol>Configure Services &amp; Settings For This Node</uicontrol> notification. 
      </p>
    
    <p>
      The
      screen now expands vertically, as follows:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <image href="../admin/picts/joinWithCustomConfig.png" id="join_cluster_expanded" align="left" width="390"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Newly display fields show default values for the four Couchbase services (with each box
      checked, indicating that each will be added to this node by default), the
      <uicontrol>Host Name/IP Address</uicontrol> for the current node, and the paths
      for <uicontrol>Data</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Indexes</uicontrol> paths. 
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note that the checkboxes for the four services are not accompanied by fields whereby
      memory quotas might be specified: this is because such quotas are expected already to
      have been specified by the Full Administrator (for example, during configuration of
      the principal cluster-host). However, in some circumstances, node-addition may feature
      addition of a service not previously configured: in which case memory-quota specification
      is required. For example, <i>uncheck</i> the checkboxes for <uicontrol>Query Service</uicontrol>
      and <uicontrol>FTS Service</uicontrol>. The checkboxes now appear as follows:
    </p>

    <p>
      <image href="../admin/picts/joinClusterServiceCheckboxes.png" id="join_cluster_service_checkboxes" align="left" width="390"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Note that due to this change, the button at the lower right has been renamed:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <image href="../admin/picts/joinWithCustomConfigurationButton.png" id="join_with_custom_configuration_button" align="left" width="160"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Left-click on this button, to save the configurations you have specified. The
      <uicontrol>New Service Settings</uicontrol> dialog now appears:
    </p>
    
    <p>
      <image href="../admin/picts/joinExistingNewServiceSettings.png" id="join_existing_new_service_settings" align="left" width="390"/>
    </p>
    
    <p>
      This dialog acknowledges that the GSI Index has been added to the cluster for the first time, and
      provides the opportunity to edit both services now added (Data and GSI), and to provide a new
      selection for the <uicontrol>Index Storage Setting</uicontrol>. Note that the modifications you
      make are applied to each node in the cluster. When you have made the appropriate changes, left-click
      on the <uicontrol>Save Settings</uicontrol> button. The Couchbase Web Console <uicontrol>Dashboard</uicontrol>
      for the current node now appears &#8212; with a notification indicating the successful saving of a
      new memory quota:
    </p>

        Install Sample Buckets
      </title>
  
      <p>
        Couchbase provides <i>sample buckets</i>, which contain data for demonstration and test purposes. The <uicontrol>Sample Buckets</uicontrol>
        screen allows you to choose which of these buckets you wish to install. The screen appears as follows:
      </p>
  
  <p>
    <image href="./picts/setup-02NewUI.png" id="image_f4x_rpy_dt" align="left" width="390"/>
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Check the corresponding checkboxes for the sample buckets you wish to to load into the Couchbase Server. Then, click the
    <uicontrol>Next</uicontrol> button. This dismisses the <uicontrol>Sample Buckets</uicontrol> screen, and displays the <uicontrol>Create Default 
    Bucket</uicontrol> screen.
  </p>
      
    </section>

  <p>
    <image href="./picts/setup-03NewUI.png" id="image_st3_cqy_dt" align="left" width="390"/>
  </p>

  <p>
    Creation of a <i>default bucket</i> is optional. The bucket contains no data by default; but can be 
    configured in detail, and used
    for testing and other purposes. It can be removed after installation, if appropriate; and
    can be re-added still later.</p>
    
  <p>
    The <uicontrol>Create Default Bucket</uicontrol> screen allows a 
    <uicontrol>Name</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Memory Quota</uicontrol> 
    for the default bucket to be established. The 
    current <uicontrol>Cluster quota</uicontrol> is represented &#8212; along with
    current allocations for <uicontrol>Other Buckets</uicontrol>, <uicontrol>This Bucket</uicontrol>,
    and <uicontrol>Free</uicontrol> memory &#8212; by the 
    horizontal display-bar.
  </p>
    
  <p>
    Additionally, the <uicontrol>Create Default Bucket</uicontrol> screen provides advanced settings, which are
    accessed by left-clicking on the <uicontrol>Show advanced bucket settings</uicontrol> tab. 
    The tab is expanded, and the screen appears as follows:
  </p>
    
    <p>
      <image href="./picts/install-createDefaultBucketAdvancedSettingsNewUI.png" id="createDefaultBucketAdvancedSettingsNewUI" align="left" width="390"/>
    </p>  
  
  <p>
    The advanced settings are described below.
  </p>
    
  <ul>
    <li><uicontrol>Bucket Type</uicontrol>
      
      <p>
        The type of the bucket can be established as <uicontrol>Couchbase</uicontrol>,
        <uicontrol>Memcached</uicontrol>, or <uicontrol>Ephemeral</uicontrol>, by means of radio-buttons. 
        <uicontrol>Couchbase</uicontrol> is initially selected by
        default. If you select <uicontrol>Memcached</uicontrol>, the appearance of the <uicontrol>Create Default Bucket</uicontrol>
        screen changes to the following:
      </p>
   
      <p>
        <image href="./picts/createDefaultBucketMemcachedSelected.png" id="createDefaultBucketMemcachedSelected" align="left" width="390"/>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        As shown by the above illustration, the <uicontrol>Replicas</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Disk I/O Optimization</uicontrol>
        sections have been omitted; since they are not pertinent to memcached buckets.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        If you click <uicontrol>Ephemeral</uicontrol>, the screen is identical to that for <uicontrol>Couchbase</uicontrol>
        buckets, with two exceptions: first, ejection-options are 
        <uicontrol>No Eviction</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>NRU Eviction</uicontrol>,
        rather than <uicontrol>Value-only</uicontrol> and <uicontrol>Full</uicontrol>; secondly, the <uicontrol>Replicate view
        indexes</uicontrol> option is omitted. These options are all described below.
      </p>
  
    </li>
    
    <li>
      
      <p id="ejection-method-selection">
        <uicontrol>Ejection Method</uicontrol>
      </p>
      
      <p>
        Ejection Method options differ between Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For Couchbase buckets, the options are <uicontrol>Value-only</uicontrol> and
        <uicontrol>Full</uicontrol>. If <uicontrol>Full</uicontrol> 
        is selected, everything (including data, metadata, key, and value) is ejected. 
        If <uicontrol>Value-only</uicontrol> is selection, only data is ejected.
        Generally, Value-only Ejection
        favors performance at the expense of memory; and Full Ejection vice versa. See 
        <xref href="../architecture/db-engine-architecture.dita#concept_b5n_bwn_vs"/>, 
        for more information. Note that <i>ejection</i> means removal from memory,
        with continued persistence on disk.

      <p>
        For Ephemeral buckets, the options are <uicontrol>No Eviction</uicontrol> and 
        <uicontrol>NRU Eviction</uicontrol>. If <uicontrol>No Eviction</uicontrol> is selected,
        no eviction of existing data occurs, and attempts to cache new data fail. If
        <uicontrol>NRU Eviction</uicontrol> is selected, existing data is evicted, with
        <i>Not Recently Used</i> documents being those removed. Note that <i>eviction</i>
        means removal from memory without persistence (since ephemeral buckets have
        no presence on disk): thus, removal is absolute.

        A <i>conflict</i> occurs during XDCR, when a document has been modified in different ways in
        different locations; so necessitating that one of the versions be chosen
        for retention, and the other discarded. There are two
        methods for making this choice; represented by the 
        <uicontrol>Sequence number</uicontrol>
        and <uicontrol>Timestamp</uicontrol> checkboxes. The method you choose is permanently established for
        the current bucket: it cannot subsequently be changed. For information on the significance of
        each method, see

    Initialize the Cluster Using the CLI

  <p>
    Rather than using the Couchbase Web Console, you may elect to initialize your Couchbase cluster by means of the Couchbase
    CLI (<i>Command Line Interface</i>).
  </p>
    
  <p>
    The following CLI syntax can be used for initial set-up of a single-node Couchbase 
    Server-cluster. It allows the establishing of administrative credentials, and of port number. It adds all services; sets 
    separate RAM quotas for Data, Index, and Search services, and sets the index storage-option (the default being to support
    memory-optimized global indexes):
