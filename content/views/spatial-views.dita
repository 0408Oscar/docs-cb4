 <title>Spatial views</title>
 <shortdesc>Couchbase Server offers spatial views to query geo-spatial information.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  
  <p>A spatial view contains geometry data that can be queried to return information based on 
   whether the recorded geometries exist within a given multi-dimensional range.</p>
  <p>Spatial views support a variety of different use cases including multi-dimensional analysis,
   geo-data, and a combination. When analyzing multi-dimensional data, spatial views can operate on
   numeric data and map categories to numbers. Spatial views support the GeoJSON format and allow
   bounding-box queries on complex geometries that are represented as points, line-strings, and
   polygons. Geospatial views also index arrays supporting flat, multi-dimensional arrays of min-max
   coordinates, and combination of arrays and GeoJSON objects</p>
  <p>Below is a spatial view written in JavaScript that emits GeoJSON within an array combined with
   document attributes.
   <codeblock>function (doc)
{
	if( typeof doc.geo != ‘undefined’ and typeof doc.updated != ‘undefined’ )
{
var geojson = {};
geojson.type = “Point”;
geojson.coordinates = [doc.geo.lon, doc.geo.lat];

var date = Date.parse(doc.updated)/1000;

//The GeoJSON object must be by convention the first element
emit([geojson, date], doc.name);
}
}</codeblock>
  </p>
