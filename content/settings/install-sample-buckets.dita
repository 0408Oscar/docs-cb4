  <title>Install Sample Buckets</title><shortdesc>The <wintitle>Sample Buckets</wintitle> tab allows you to install the sample bucket data
    if it has not already been loaded in the system.</shortdesc>

      <note type="important"><p>To install sample buckets, an administrator must have one of these roles: <ul>
            <li>Full administrator</li>
            <li>Cluster administrator</li>
          </ul></p>
        <p>To learn about administrative roles in Couchbase, see<xref

    <note type="important">Remove the default bucket and sample buckets in production. Both types of
      buckets are created without a password protection and if permissions to such buckets are later
      assigned to users they will become "orphaned" in case these buckets are deleted.</note>

    <p>If the sample bucket data was not loaded during setup, select the sample buckets that you
      want to load using the check-boxes and click <uicontrol>Create</uicontrol>. </p>
    <p>If the sample bucket data has already been loaded, it is listed under the <wintitle>Installed
        Samples</wintitle> section of the page. </p>

    <note type="note">The sample buckets are located in the Couchbase installation directory as .zip
      files as well. On Linux, the default location would be
        <filepath>/opt/couchbase/samples</filepath>
      <p>The sample bucket Zip files can be loaded into the cluster by using the <xref
          href="../cli/cbdocloader-tool.dita#cbdocloader_tool">cbdocloader </xref>tool.</p> Example:
      <codeblock> /opt/couchbase/bin/cbdocloader -n localhost:8091 -u Admin -p Pass -b mybucket -s 100 /opt/couchbase/samples/travel-sample.zip</codeblock>
