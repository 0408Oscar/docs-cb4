        <note type="important">To configure compaction settings for a cluster, an administrator must have one of these roles: <ul>
            <li>Full administrator</li>
            <li>Cluster administrator</li>
          </ul>
          To learn about administrative roles in Couchbase, see <xref

      <p>You can override these auto-compaction settings using <xref
        href="../clustersetup/create-bucket.dita#topic_fym_kmn_vs">per-bucket </xref>settings that
      are available when creating or editing data buckets. </p>
    <p>You can provide a purge interval to remove the key and metadata for items that have been
      deleted or are expired, which is known as <xref
        href="../architecture/core-data-access-bucket-disk-storage.dita#concept_cy4_tr2_xs"

              <p>Defaults to three days. <term>Tombstones</term> are records of expired or deleted
                items, and they include the key and metadata. Tombstones are used in Couchbase
                Server to provide eventual consistency of data between clusters.</p>
              <p>The auto-compaction process waits this number of days before it permanently deletes
                tombstones for expired or deleted items. </p>
              <p>If you set this value too low, you may see more inconsistent results in views
                queries such as deleted items in a result set. You may also see inconsistent items
                in clusters with XDCR set up between the clusters. If you set this value too high,
                it will delay the server from reclaiming disk space.</p>
