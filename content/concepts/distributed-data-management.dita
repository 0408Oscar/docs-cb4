 <title>Distributed data management </title>
 <shortdesc>Couchbase Server is a distributed system that is built from the ground up for easy scale out and management.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <p> Couchbase Server is typically deployed on a cluster of commodity servers although for development purposes all functionality can be run on a single node. This also means that an application developed at small scale (even on a laptop) can be deployed to a distributed cluster, or separate clusters of varied topologies, without any architecture or behavioral changes to that application.  Couchbase Server has a peer-to-peer topology and all the nodes play the same role in a cluster, that is, all the nodes are equal and communicate to each other on demand. There is no concept of master nodes, slave nodes, config nodes, name nodes, head nodes, etc.  This model works particularly well with cloud infrastructure, in which nodes can be added or removed without considering their “type”. Capacity can be increased or decreased simply by adding or removing nodes. In this way a cluster can grow CPU, RAM, disk and network capacity by adding physical servers or virtual machines that have the exact same software installed. Nodes can be  added or removed easily through a rebalance process, which re-distributes the data evenly across all nodes. The rebalance process is done online and requires no application downtime, and can be initiated at the click of a button.</p>
