    <p>Couchbase Server 4.5 leaps forward with faster, simpler, and more secure data processing.
      Take a look at <xref href="whats-new.dita">What's new?</xref> for a list of new features and
      improvements that are available in this Developer Preview release. <note type="important">The
        developer preview version of Couchbase Server 4.5  is intended for development purposes
        only. We consider developer preview releases to have some rough edges and bugs, and may
        change significantly before the final GA release. The preview release is <b>not
          supported</b> in production.</note></p>
    
    <section><title>Upgrade</title>
      <p>Couchbase Server 4.5 Developer Preview (DP) is an early developer milestone update and
        requires a fresh install. </p>
      <p>Upgrading from an earlier version of Couchbase Server is not supported. </p>
    </section>
    
   <section><title>Behavior changes</title>
     <p>These are the latest changes you will find in Couchbase Server 4.5 Developer Preview: </p>
   <p><ul>
     <li>Disabling scientific notation for integers. With this change, large integers are no longer
            displayed in the scientific notation in N1QL. Details for the change can be found in
              <xref href="https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-14720" format="html"
              scope="external">MB-14720</xref>.</li>
     <li><codeph>PENDING</codeph> index state is now represented as <codeph>DEFERRED</codeph> and <codeph>BUILDING</codeph>.
       With this change, global indexes no longer display a <codeph>PENDING</codeph> state under status in <codeph>SYSTEM:INDEXES</codeph>. 
       Instead, global indexes that are actively being built display 
       <codeph>BUILDING</codeph> and global indexes that are created with the <codeph>DEFER_BUILD</codeph> option display 
       <codeph>DEFERRED</codeph> for status attribute in the <codeph>SYSTEM:INDEXES</codeph> output in N1QL. Details for the change can be found in
              <xref href="https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/MB-14679" format="html"
              scope="external">MB-14679</xref>.</li>
     <li>The new <cmdname>backup</cmdname> tool is not backward compatible with older backup files
            from previous releases. <p>If you want to take a backup of a previous release and then
              load and restore it in Couchbase 4.5, you should use the <cmdname>cbbackup</cmdname>
              tool (not the new <cmdname>backup</cmdname> tool). After you restore the data into
              4.5, you can start using the new <cmdname>backup</cmdname> tool for subsequent
              backup/restore operations to other 4.5 nodes.</p></li>
   </ul></p>

    <section><title>Limitations</title>
      <p>Here are the limitations you will encounter when using Couchbase Server 4.5 Developer
        Preview: <ul>
          <li>Full Text Search (FTS) is only supported on a single node in a cluster. You can have
            multiple nodes in the cluster, but only one node can run the FTS service. <note
              type="note">You are not prevented from starting the FTS service on multiple nodes.
              However, if you do, you may encounter unpredictable behavior. </note></li>
          <li>FTS won’t have the following options: rebalance, failover or rollback. <p>Experimental
              FTS API support is available in Java 2.2.4 beginning February 17, 2016. Experimental
              FTS API support begins with the following SDK versions as of April 5, 2016:  Python
              2.0.9, GO 1.06,  NET 2.2.7, and Node.js 2.1.5.</p></li>
          <li>There is no authorization in place for any FTS operation.</li>
          <li>Only the role of full administrator is implemented in this preview. Administrators
            will have to log into Couchbase using full administrator credentials to manage the
            cluster.</li>
          <li>Sub-document API:  Experimental subdocument API Support is available beginning with GO
            1.04, and in libcouchbase (C) 2.5.6 as of February 17, 2016. Experimental subdocument
            API support begins as of March 1, 2016, with the following SDK versions:  Python 2.0.8,
            Java 2.2.5,  NET 2.2.6, and Node.js 2.1.4. </li>
          <li>Results of query monitoring will only be available in CBQ ( Anil - Does it mean
            results are shown in old CBQ, REST)?</li>
          <li>The Couchbase Web Console does not display the <wintitle>Query</wintitle> tab if the
            query node is not installed and running. (Anil to confirm – Does this tab show up in web
            console if not a query node? Does this tab show links to other nodes in the cluster that
            are running the query service? )</li>
          <li>The Finegrain Array Indexing feature has these limitations: <ul>
              <li>Supports only ARRAY, DISTINCT, IN, and WITHIN operators.</li>
              <li>Does not support covering indexes.</li>
              <li>Does not maintain duplicate elements of an array or the position of elements
                within an array, and hence does not support expressions reconstructing the full
                array, or address the elements by position. </li>
            </ul></li>
          <li><codeph>Memory Optimized Indexes </codeph>is a cluster-wide setting and currently
            cannot coexist with other types of GSI indexes such as Forestdb.</li>
          <li>Memory Optimized Indexes MUST completely fit in memory. Mutations will not get
            propagated to the indexes in case of Out-of-memory errors.</li>
          <li>During installation, you can choose between ForestDB or Memory Optimized Indexes to
            manage Global Secondary Indexes. This setting cannot be changed post installation; to
            change this setting you would have to re-instal Couchbase. Changing the optimization
            mode of global indexes is not supported when index service nodes are present in the
            cluster. Please remove all index service nodes to change this option.</li>
        </ul></p>
