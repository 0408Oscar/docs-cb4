  <title>What's new in version 4.5 - Developer Preview?</title>
  <body>
    <p>Couchbase Server 4.5 leaps forward with faster, simpler, and more secure data processing. 
      <note type="important">This is a developer preview version of Couchbase Server 4.5 and is intended for development purposes only.
        We consider developer preview releases to have some rough edges and bugs, and may change significantly before the final GA release. This release is <b>not supported</b> in production.</note></p>
    <section><title>Faster</title>
      <p>Couchbase Server added support for prepared execution of N1QL statements and covering
        indexes for faster queries. Query and Indexing got another boost with version 4.5.</p>

          <dd>Version 4 of Couchbase Server introduced <xref

              format="html" scope="external">global indexes</xref> which are<xref

            faster N1QL queries. With the new memory-optimized global indexes in 4.5, Couchbase
            Server provides further tuning for in-memory index processing and index scans for the
            lowest latencies with N1QL. In other databases indexes might impact the performance of
            mutations, data ingest and DML through SQL INSERT UPDATE and DELETE, In Couchbase
            Server, the new memory-optimized global indexes provide a fresh index that is up-to-date
            under aggressive mutation rates without impacting the incoming database workload. You
            can enable the new memory-optimized global indexes through the index settings under the
              <wintitle>Settings</wintitle> tab in the Couchbase Server Web Console. For more information, see <xref href="in-memory-indexes.dita"></xref>.</dd>

          <dt>Indexing Embedded Arrays</dt>
          <dd>Couchbase Server provides a native data model that can easily represent complex
            relationships in a simple natural document. In relational databases, “Movies” and
            “Showtimes” would be two separate tables whereas, in the native document database like
            Couchbase Server, data model naturally adapts to the applications representation or
            movies which would be a single “Movie” instance that contains the “Showtimes” array.</dd>
            <dd>N1QL provides a considerable number of verbs around array processing embedded
            structures and arrays such as <codeph>UNNEST</codeph> and
              <codeph>ANY</codeph>/<codeph>EVERY</codeph> operators. With the new array indexing
            feature, developers can optimize execution of the queries. The new index can optimize
            queries that are looking for showtimes through indexes. You can index embedded arrays
            using the new <codeph>ALL</codeph> keyword in<xref

      <p>Development and administration become much simpler with Couchbase Server 4.5. </p>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>Advanced Partial Updates and Data Structures</dt>
          <dd>With Couchbase Server 4.5, applications no longer have to address the entire document.
            With the extended APIs, developers can operate on parts of a document without having to
            send the entire document back and forth between client and server. The result is
            enhanced performance and efficiency in the network IO path, especially when documents in
            the system are large. For more information, see <xref href="sub-doc-api.dita"></xref>.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Integrated Query Workbench</dt>
          <dd>Couchbase Server 4.5 also provides a simple and visual way to develop and design
            queries. Query workbench allows executing ad hoc queries directly from the console to
            help developers and administrators interact with the system in development, test, and
            product environments. To use the new integrated query workbench, switch to the new Query
            tab in the Couchbase Server Web Console. For more information,  see <xref href="query-workbench.dita"></xref>.</dd>

        <dlentry>
          <dt>Flexible JOINs in N1QL</dt>
          <dd>With version 4.5, N1QL introduces an extended <codeph>JOIN</codeph> syntax for added
            flexibility in JOINs. The new <codeph>JOIN ON KEY</codeph> … <codeph>FOR</codeph>
            keyword allows developers to specify JOIN operations that can use the left or the right
            keyspace for the JOIN. With the addition of the extended syntax, N1QL also allows much
            better use of indexes to perform the JOIN operation faster across the two sides, and
            substantially lowers JOIN latencies. For example;
            <codeblock>SELECT * FROM Playlists JOIN Songs ON KEY</codeblock> You can find more about
            the new JOIN syntax here. For more information, see <xref
              href="n1ql-enhancements.dita#topic_b4g_4bb_y5/flexible-join"/>.</dd>
        </dlentry>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Query Profiling</dt>
          <dd>N1QL adds several new keyspaces under the “system:” namespace to the existing list
            that allows listing indexes, buckets, and more. The new keyspaces under System: allow
            monitoring active executions, connections and more. For a full list of new system
            keyspaces added to N1QL, please visit the details page.</dd>

          <dt>Advanced Command-line Tooling for Query</dt>
          <dd>In previous releases, the <cmdname>cbq</cmdname> command line tool has been the
            central point for executing N1QL queries. Command line access to N1QL has been greatly
            improved in this release, and the new command line access provides smart connection
            management and full scriptability with version 4.5. For more information, see <xref href="cbq-shell.dita"></xref>.</dd>

          <dt>Enterprise Backup and Restore</dt>
          <dd>Couchbase Server 4.5 provides a new enterprise backup and restore tool that can back
            up larger datasets with much higher performance. The backup and restore capabilities are
            critical to ensuring disaster recovery and business continuity. The scalable,
            high-performance backup and restore tool allows Couchbase Server to provide faster
            recovery with better RTO (Recovery Time Objective) and RPO (Recovery Point Objective).
