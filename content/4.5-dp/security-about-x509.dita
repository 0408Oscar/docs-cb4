      <note type="note">Couchbase administrators should manually pre-install all client machines
        with the root CA public keys before rotating server certificates. The server will send the
        certificate chain to the client, which will then validate the chain using the root public
        key. </note>

         <dd>Only the intermediate certificate is rotated, and the root certificate is unchanged.
            For new connections only, the server sends the certificate chain with the new
            intermediate certificate. This new certificate gets verified by the client, and the
            connection is re-established. </dd>
