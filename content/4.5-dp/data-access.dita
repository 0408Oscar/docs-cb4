  <title>Data access</title>

    <p>The vast majority of modifications (and perhaps retrievals) of specific documents only operate on a subset of the document. The entire content of a document is typically written only once during the initial creation of the document.
In version 4.1 (and earlier), modification to any JSON document within Couchbase Server consisted of the following tasks:<ol>
  <li>Retrieving the entire document content over the network.</li>
  <li>Performing a transformation on the document (typically on a small, addressable subset thereof)</li>
  <li>Setting the contents of the entire document back again into the server.</li>
</ol>
These series of steps introduced significant performance implications, not just for client-to-server transactions, but also for server-to-server communication. Any time a client modifies a document, the entire content of the document must be replicated across the cluster. To mitigate these issues, we introduce the sub document API in Couchbase Server 4.5 Developer Preview release. </p>
