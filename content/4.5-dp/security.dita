  <body>
    <!--<p>Couchbase Server provides security features that allow the administrators to implement
      various security controls to ensure secure deployment.</p>--> 
    <p>We’re continuously improving security in Couchbase. Starting with 4.5 Developer Preview
      we’re introducing <xref href="security-x509.dita#topic_gp4_1yl_s5">X.509 Certificates for
        TLS</xref> between client-to-server and cross-datacenter (XDCR) communications. This
      provides a strongly trusted channel for encrypting sensitive data on the wire.</p>
    <!--<p>We are also working on the Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), and this feature will be
      available for preview in the Beta release of Couchbase Server 4.5. We are interested in
      learning about your RBAC use cases. We encourage you to <xref

        format="html" scope="external">provide your input</xref>, and we will let you know as soon
      as this feature becomes available for you to try. </p>-->
    <p>We believe that we are making important improvements to the product security, and understand
      that changes like these might trigger a lot of questions. If you want to provide feedback, you
      can file an issue directly in our <xref
