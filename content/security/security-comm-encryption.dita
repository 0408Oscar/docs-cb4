  <shortdesc>Couchbase encrypts the data moving between client and server, between servers within a
    cluster, and between data centers. </shortdesc>

<section><title>Data moving between client and server</title>Data moving between client and server
      needs to be protected from any attackers eavesdropping on the connection. Couchbase Server
      enables encrypted data access using SSL for client-server communications. <dl>

          <dd>Couchbase Server also includes support for secure administrative access, which enables
            administrators to administer the server securely through the browser using a public
            network.  </dd>

          <dd>When you enable SSL data to and from the server is encrypted using the server
            certificate configured and stored in the client certificate store. It is a good security
            best practice to regenerate the SSL certificate periodically, as per your organization's
            security policy. </dd>

  <section><title>Data moving between servers within a cluster</title>Your data has to be available
      all the time (24x7x365) and your applications must be able to access that data even if any of
      the servers in the cluster dies. To ensure high availability, Couchbase Server replicates data
      within the cluster and across data centers. <p>If you encrypt all your sensitive data in the
        documents, the replica copies will be transmitted as is (encrypted) and stored. For added
        security, it is a good security practice to use IPSec on the network that connects the
        Couchbase server nodes. </p></section>
  <section><title>Data moving between data centers</title>To protect sensitive data transmitted among
      data centers in different geo-locations, use the secure XDCR (Cross Datacenter Replication)
      feature. <p> Secure XDCR enables you to encrypt traffic between two data centers using an SSL
        connection. When you use secure XDCR, all traffic in the source and destination data centers
        will be encrypted. Encryption causes a slight increase in the CPU load to allow for
        additional CPU cycles.</p><p>It is a good security practice to rotate the XDCR certificates
        periodically, as per your organization's security policy.</p>
