    Authorization is the mechanism whereby a system determines what level of resource-access 
    should be granted an authenticated user or application.

        Role-Based Access Control
      </title>
      
    <p>
      Couchbase provides <i>Role-Based Access Control</i> (RBAC), whereby both administrators and
      applications can be authorized. This allows the accessing of system-resources to be controlled with fine
      granularity. Potentially, therefore, whereas some administrators might be granted full read-write
      permission on all areas of Couchbase Server, others might be granted only more narrowly defined forms of
      access. For example, an administrator might be allowed read-permission on the whole system, but
      no ability to write; or, might be given read or write permission only on a subset of buckets,
      indexes, or views. 
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Similarly, applications might be permited to select bucket-data, but not
      insert; or, might be permitted to update, insert, and upsert, but not delete.
    </p>
      
    <p>
      Couchbase clusters, bucket-data, bucket-statistics, views, indexes, catalogs, and
      backup and replication activities can all be protected in this way. An appropriately
      authorized administrator can use the Couchbase Web Console to grant specific combinations 
      of access-permission to different recipients.
