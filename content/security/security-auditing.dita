    Auditing
  </title>
  
  <shortdesc>
    Actions performed on Couchbase Server can be <i>audited</i>. This allows a full
    administrator to ensure that system-management tasks are being appropriately
    performed; and also facilitates compliance with regulatory standards.

        Audit Records and their Content
      </title>
    
      <p>
        The records created by the Couchbase Auditing facililty capture information on
        <i>who</i> has done <i>what</i>, <i>when</i>, and <i>how</i>.
      </p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>
          <i>Who</i> refers to administrators performing actions. To access the system, each
          administrator has authenticated, either locally or by means of LDAP: and is therefore
          identifiable throughout their session.

        <li>
          <i>What</i> refers to the administrative action being performed. 30 different kinds
          of action are tracked by Couchbase Server.

          <i>When</i> refers to the UTC time stamp that corresponds to each recorded action.

          <i>How</i> refers to the success or failure status resulting from the recorded action.

      <p>
        Audit records are created by Couchbase Server-processes, which run asynchronously. Each
        record is stored as a JSON file, which can be retrieved and inspected.

          Configuring the Couchbase Auditing Facility
        </title>
        
        <p>
          Only a <i>full administrator</i> can configure auditing. Configuration is performed by 
          means of the Couchbase Web Console.
        </p>
        
        <p>To configure auditing select: 
          <menucascade><uicontrol>Security</uicontrol>
          <uicontrol>Audit</uicontrol>
        </menucascade>:</p>

            <dd>This is a log rotation time interval (in Days, Hours, or Minutes), after which the log
              gets rotated to the next file. </dd>

        <p>The following CLI syntax is used to configure Couchbase auditing for administrators:</p>
        
        <codeblock>couchbase-cli 
          setting-audit  OPTIONS
          --audit-log-rotate-interval=[MINUTES]     //log rotation interval
          --audit-log-path=[PATH]                   //target log directory
          --audit-enabled=[0|1]                     //enable auditing or not</codeblock>
