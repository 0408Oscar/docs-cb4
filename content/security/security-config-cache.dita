  <title>Client configuration cache</title><shortdesc>The client configuration cache file contains the current cluster configuration that
    Couchbase Server uses at startup.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>The majority of the Couchbase clusters are
      running in a steady state most of the time, which means that the cluster nodes are not removed or
      added very often. Since clients only infrequently receive an update from the cluster whose
      topology is changing, cluster information is well suited for caching.</p> 
    <p>When the client is instantiated, it looks for a cached named file in the file system. If the
      file is there, the client assumes that it belongs to a current cluster configuration and
      starts using it. If it isn't there, the client starts a normal bootstrap to get the
      configuration from the cluster and writes it to a file. </p>
    <p>Whenever you try to access an item on a node and the node tells you that you tried to
      communicate with the wrong node, you invalidate the cache and request a new copy of the
      configuration cache. </p><p>To use the configuration cache from PHP, add the following
          to the file <codeph>php.ini</codeph>:
          <codeblock>couchbase.config_cache = /tmp </codeblock></p>
    <p>Use of the configuration cache applies only to PHP (not to Java and .NET).</p>
