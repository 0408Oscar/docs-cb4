 <title>Role-based Access for Administrators</title>
 <shortdesc>Authorization defines the roles that Couchbase administrators perform after they connect
    to the system.</shortdesc>
 <conbody>
    <p>Role-based access for administrators in Couchbase is designed to achieve segregation of
      administrative duties so that each administrator can only perform a well-defined fixed set of
      operations based on the job description.  </p>

        <dd>The initial built-in full Couchbase administrator authenticated during Couchbase Server
          installation has the full access and privileges to manage all Couchbase Server functions.
          There is one full administrator per Couchbase Server, and his user ID is mapped from the
          LDAP server using the Couchbase Web Console, as explained in <b>Authentication</b>.</dd>

      <title>New Administrative Roles</title>
      <p>Several new administrative roles have been introduced to achieve segregation of duties for
        administrators. Administrators in all roles have read-only access to user data and querying
        statistics. For example, the bucket administrators can see other buckets but cannot perform
        any operations on them. </p>
      <note type="important">New administrative roles currently require that LDAP is enabled.
        Therefore, role-based access for the new administrative roles is not supported on Windows
        and Mac platforms.</note>

          <dt>Cluster Administrator </dt>
          <dd>The cluster administrators can manage all cluster operations except for the cluster
            security settings. They are unable to update the Administrator credentials, enable or
            disable LDAP or modify auditing settings.</dd>
