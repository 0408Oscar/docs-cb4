  Application Access-Testing
 </title>
 
 <shortdesc>
  <i>Role-Based Access Control</i> requires applications to pass appropriate 
  credentials, in order to perform specific operations. Using the Couchbase Web Console, in combination 
  with N1QL queries executed by means of the <codeph>cbq</codeph>
  tool, you can run RBAC tests; and thereby make sure that your applications
  have been assigned the correct roles.

    You can test in three stages:
   </p>
   
   <ol>
    
    <li>
     Create a bucket containing documents, different levels of access to which can be assigned to different
     users. This is described in the section
     <xref href="./security-create-bucket-for-access-testing.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Create and Populate a Bucket</xref>.
    
     <p>
      <!-- Vertical space -->
      
     </p>
    
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Create users with different role-combinations. See
     <xref href="./security-create-users-for-access-testing.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Create Users and Assign Roles</xref>.
     
     <p>
      <!-- Vertical space -->
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Use the <codeph>cbq</codeph> tool to test bucket-access, according to the roles you have assigned to users. 
     See 
     <xref href="./security-perform-cbq-access-tests.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Perform cbq Access Tests</xref>.
