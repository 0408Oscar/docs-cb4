  Application Access Testing
 </title>
 
 <shortdesc>
  The Couchbase <i>Role-Based Access Control</i> system ensures that application must pass the correct 
  credentials, in order to perform specific operations. Using the Couchbase Web Console in combination 
  with N1QL queries, executed by means of the <codeph>cbq</codeph>
  tool, you can establish access control on one or more buckets, and experiment with the effect this has on
  applications' attempt to read or write data. This is demonstrated by the examples in this section.

    You can test in three stages:
   </p>
   
   <ol>
    
    <li>
     Create a bucket containing documents, different levels of access to which can be assigned to different
     users. This is described in the section
     <xref href="./security-create-bucket-for-access-testing.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Create and Populate a Bucket</xref>.
    
     <p>
      <!-- Vertical space -->
      
     </p>
    
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Create users with different role-combinations. This is described in
     <xref href="./security-create-users-for-access-testing.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Create Users and Assign Roles</xref>.
     
     <p>
      <!-- Vertical space -->
     </p>
    </li>
    
    <li>
     Use the <codeph>cbq</codeph> tool to attempt bucket-access, according to the roles you have assigned different users. 
     This is described in 
     <xref href="./security-perform-cbq-access-tests.dita" scope="local" format="dita">Perform cbq Access Tests</xref>.
    </li>
