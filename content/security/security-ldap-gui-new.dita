  <title>Setting Up External Roles</title>
  <shortdesc>Only the Full Administrator can configure other Couchbase administrators.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    
    <p>Since the Couchbase Web Console can only read the LDAP database (and cannot write to it), all
      administrators must be created on the LDAP server. After the user IDs of these LDAP
      administrators have been defined, they can be mapped to Couchbase Server using the Couchbase
      Web Console. </p>
    <p>Couchbase Server supports multiple <xref href="concepts-rba.dita#concept_ntl_jph_hr"

    <section><title>Enabling Authentication </title>
  
    <p>Authenticatiion is disabled by default. To enable authentication for administrators, follow
        these steps:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Select <menucascade>
            <uicontrol>Security</uicontrol>
            <uicontrol>External User/Roles</uicontrol>
          </menucascade>. <p><image href="pict/enable-auth.png" id="image_lgt_s5r_nv" align="left"
              width="720"/></p></li>
      <li>Click the <uicontrol>enable</uicontrol> link to turn on authentication. If a user doesn't
          want to associate the installation with LDAP, this option can be turned off.</li>
    
    </ol>
    </section>
    
   <section><title>Add Administrators</title>
  <p>With the authenticatio enabled, the Full Administrator can add administrators by setting up 
    their credentials as well as the specific role.</p>   
  <ol>
    <li>Click on the <uicontrol>Add User</uicontrol> button on the right.</li>
    <li>In the <wintitle>Manage User: New</wintitle> dialog, enter the username and select the role
          from the drop-down list. <p><image href="pict/manage-user-new.png" id="image_zvj_2wr_nv"
              align="left" width="350"/>
          </p><p>The roles are:</p><ul>
            <li><codeph>Admin</codeph> is the Full Administrator role, which can manage all cluster
              features inscluding the security settings.</li>
            <li><codeph>Read Only Admin</codeph> can view all cluster features without being able to
              edit them.</li>
            <li><codeph>Cluster Admin</codeph> can manage all cluster features except for the
              security settings.</li>
            <li><codeph>Bucket Administrator</codeph> can manage all bucket features for a specified
              bucket. When denoted with an asterisk [*], this role can manage all buckets in a
              cluster.</li>
            <li><codeph>Views Administrator</codeph> can manage views for specified buckets. When
              denoted with an asterisk [*] , this role can manage all views in a cluster.</li>
            <li><codeph>Replication Admin</codeph> can manage only the XDCR features on the cluster
              and bucket level.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
     
 
    <li>The Full Administrator can always manage all existing administrative roles in this same
          dialog and add a new role to particular users, or remove the roles from their list.

  <!--  <section><title>Mapping Administrator IDs from the LDAP Server</title>
    
    <p>To map the LDAP administrators using the Couchbase Web Console, follow these steps: </p><ol>
          <li>In the <wintitle>Read-Only Admins</wintitle> window, enter the Read-only Administrator
          IDs. </li>
          <li>In the <wintitle>Full Admins</wintitle> window, enter the Full Administrator IDs.
            <note type="important">Both for the full and for the Read-only Administrator, enter only
            one user ID per line and press <uicontrol>Enter</uicontrol> after each user ID. If you
            try to separate user IDs with commas, these will be treated as a part of the
            ID.</note><note type="important">To enter userIDs using CLI, see <xref
              href="../cli/cli-overview.dita#cli-overview"/>. </note></li>
      
          <li>Select the appropriate radio button to designate which administrators are used as a
          default: <codeph>Read-only</codeph>, <codeph>Full Admins</codeph>, or
            <codeph>None</codeph>. <p>All users have to be first authenticated with the LDAP server
            to have access. However, if a user ID was not entered in the UI either as the full or
            Read-only Administrator, that user will have a role that has been assigned as the
              <codeph>default</codeph>. </p></li>
          <li>Enter a username and a password. </li>
      <li>Click on <uicontrol>Validate</uicontrol> to test the user.</li>
    </ol>
    </section>
    <section><title>Test LDAP Settings</title> To test the LDAP settings: <ol>
        <li>Sign out of the Couchbase Web Console.</li>
        <li>Try to log in with the new administrative credentials. <ul>
            <li>If you enter the credentials of the Full Administrator, the screen will provide full
              access to all functions available through the Couchbase Web Console (see the
                <wintitle>LDAP Auth Setup</wintitle> screen above).</li>
            <li>If you enter credentials of the Read-only Administrator, a screen with the read-only
              view will become available. This screen doesn't allow the user to enable or disable
              LDAP, or to configure administrators. </li>
          </ul></li>
