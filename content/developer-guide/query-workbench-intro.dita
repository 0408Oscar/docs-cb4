 <title>Query workbench [Developer Preview]</title>
 <shortdesc> The query workbench provides a rich graphical user interface to prepare and execute simple to complex N1QL queries. It provides a convenient way to perform query development by enabling you to browse, create, and run N1QL statements, and view results. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <section>
   <note type="important">The query workbench is available as a developer preview and works with Couchbase Server 4.0. The feature is still considered experimental and the UI or the functionality may change. The Developer Preview version is not meant to be used in Production.</note>
   <p>The query workbench is the graphical version of the command line tool <codeph>cbq</codeph>. It addresses some of the limitations seen when using the command line tool: <ul>
    <li>Provides a better way to view and edit complex queries by supporting features such as multi-line formatting, copy and paste, and easy cursor movement. </li>
    <li>Enables you to choose to view the results in a more compact and readable format such as a table or a tree, in addition to the default JSON format.</li>
    <li>Supports the N1QL <cmdname>describe</cmdname> command, which returns the structure of documents in a bucket which will help write better queries. You no longer have to select the documents at random and then guess the structure of the document. </li>
   </ul> </p>
   <p><b>Supported platforms</b>
   The query workbench is supported on Windows, Linux, and Mac OS X platforms. </p>

  <section><title>Installing the query workbench</title>
   <p><ol>
    <li>Download the query workbench archive file <codeph>couchbase-query-workbench_dp1-&lt;<varname>os</varname>&gt;</codeph> from "Link". </li>
    <li>Extract the query workbench tool and optionally copy the entire folder, <filepath>couchbase-query-workbench</filepath>, to a temporary location.</li>
   </ol></p></section>
  
  <section><title>Running the query workbench</title>
   <p><ol>
    <li>Open a terminal and navigate to the extracted folder. </li>
    <li>The query workbench is configured to connect to your local datastore at
       <codeph>127.0.0.0:8091</codeph> using the default credentials. To connect to a different
      datastore, edit the <filepath>launch-cbq-gui.sh</filepath> file located in the extracted
      folder and update the variable <varname>COUCHBASE_URL</varname>. </li>
    <li>To launch the query workbench, run the following command:
      <codeblock>./launch-cbq-gui.sh</codeblock></li>
    <li>After the query web server starts successfully, you can now access query workbench UI from
        <filepath>http://<varname>COUCHBASE_URL</varname>:8094</filepath>. Look for a console
      message similar to the following:
      <codeblock>Go to /ui to use the query UI.
Running: ./cbq-gui -datastore=http://127.0.0.1:8091 -localPort=:8094 -user= -pass=
Launching query web service.
    Using CB Server at: http://127.0.0.1:8091
    Using N1QL query service on: 127.0.0.1:8093
    Using memcached service on: 127.0.0.1:11210
    Using web content at: ./static
Launching UI server, to use, point browser at http://localhost:8094/ui
Hit enter to stop server:</codeblock></li>
   </ol>
    </p>

  <section><title>Query workbench reference</title>
  <p>The query workbench has three main sections: <ul>
     <li>N1QL query view</li>
     <li>Results view</li>
     <li>Metadata view</li>
