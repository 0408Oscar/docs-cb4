  <title>Create XDCR replication</title><shortdesc>XDCR replications are configured on a per-bucket basis.</shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Configure the replications from the XDCR tab of the Couchbase Web Console. To replicate data
      from all buckets in a cluster, individually configure replication for each bucket. </p>
    <p>Before configuring XDCR:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Configure all nodes within each cluster to communicate with all the nodes on the destination cluster. 
        XDCR uses any node in a cluster to replicate between the two clusters.</li>
      <li>Ensure that all Couchbase Server versions and platforms match. For instance, if you want to replicate from a Linux-based cluster, 
        you need to do so with another Linux-based cluster.</li>
      <li>Couchbase Server uses TCP/IP port <codeph>8091</codeph> to exchange cluster configuration
        information. If you are communicating with a destination cluster over a dedicated connection
        or the Internet, you should ensure that all the nodes in the destination and source clusters
        can communicate with each other over ports <codeph>8091</codeph> and
        <codeph>8092</codeph>.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><term>Ongoing Replications</term> are the ones that are configured and operating currently.
      You can monitor the current configuration, current status, and the last time a replication
      process was triggered for each configured replication.</p>
    <p>Under the XDCR tab, you can also configure <term>Remote Clusters </term>for XDCR; these are
      named destination clusters you can select when you configure replication. When you configure
      XDCR, the destination cluster reference should point to the IP address of one of the nodes in
      the destination cluster.</p>
