  <title>XDCR conflict resolution</title>
  <shortdesc>Conflict resolution makes XDCR an ideal solution for high availability use cases. </shortdesc>
  <body>
    <p>Failing over to a secondary cluster under cluster-wide or partial failures is critical for
      providing a full availability on the database tier. Therefore, XDCR is often used as an
      availability solution since the RevID-based model (a model based on a revision ID) behaves
      ideally under failover conditions. </p>
<p>In addition to the RevID type of conflict resolution, Couchbase Server implements <!--two other
      types: LWW (Last-Write-Wins) and--> Timestamp. </p>
      <dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>Revision ID</dt>
          <dd>The default resolution type is Revision ID-based. Enable Revision ID at the Couchbase
          bucket level during the initial setup and then change it if needed at a later time.</dd>
        </dlentry>
      </dl>
 <!--
      <dl>
        <dlentry>
          <dt>LWW (Last-Write-Wins)</dt>
          <dd>LWW-based conflict resolution is an option configured on the Couchbase bucket level
          during initial setup. </dd>
        <dd>You can configure the documents to resolve their conflicts using LWW only if  the
          logical timestamps across the nodes are synchronized. If you enable the LWW option at the
          time when you add nodes to a cluster, such node can go online and receive mutation traffic
          only after it has its logical timestamp adjusted. </dd>
        <dd>You can enable the LWW option using CLI, UI, or REST. </dd>
        <dd>All nodes in all clusters participating in the LWW conflict resolution require Network
          Time Protocol (NTP) since timestamps are mainly generated through clocks. Administrators
          are required to set up and synchronize clocks using NTP on all platforms before enabling
          LWW, or before adding new nodes to any cluster involved in XDCR replications with LWW. </dd>
        <dd>Couchbase Server does not validate or check NTP setup or clock drift. Either NTP or
          other clock synchronization facilities on all platforms must guarantee that the timestamps
          are correct within 5 seconds to support LWW. </dd>
        <dd>LWW support might not be possible on all platforms, such as on Windows that's giving the
            <systemoutput>W32Time</systemoutput> error.</dd>
        </dlentry>
      </dl>
    <note type="important">LWW-based conflict resolution can be mixed with the Revision ID-based
      conflict resolution neither for simple nor complex topologies. </note>-->
    
    <dl>
      <dlentry>
        <dt>Timestamp</dt>
        <dd><!--Use timestamp-based conflict resolution before LWW.--> When the system detects  identical
          revision IDs or identical timestamps while resolving conflicts, it allows the larger value
          to win after comparing them. </dd>
        <dd>The order for comparing values in the system is as follows: <ol>
            <li>CAS (Create and Set) Value</li>
            <li>Document flag</li>
            <li>Expiration TTL (Time to Live) value</li>
