 <title>Intra-cluster replication </title>
 <shortdesc>Intra-cluster replication in Couchbase Server is achieved using the Database Change Protocol (DCP). </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <section> <title>Replicas</title>
   <p>Replicas are copies of data that are placed on another node in a cluster. The source of the replicated vBucket data is called the master vBucket. Master vBuckets perform read and write operations. The destination vBucket is called the replica vBucket. Replica vBuckets receive a continuous stream of mutations from the master vBucket through the Database Change Protocol (DCP).</p>
   <p>Within the data service, master vBuckets are spread across the cluster for even distribution
    of data and best performance. Additional replicas are optional. Administrators can create
    between one and three additional copies (replica vBuckets) of the master vBuckets. Replica
    vBuckets are also spread across the cluster for best availability and can use failure domain
    definitions to guide distribution. For example, to protect against the node failure domain,
    Couchbase Server places a master vBucket and its corresponding replica vBucket on separate nodes
    or separate racks. <fig id="fig_z5p_ybd_ws">

  <section> <title>Database Change Protocol (DCP) </title>
   <p>Database Change Protocol (DCP) is the protocol used to stream bucket level mutations. DCP is used for high speed replication of mutations to maintain replica vBuckets, incremental Map-Reduce views and spatial views, Global Secondary Indexes (GSIs), cross datacenter replication, backups, and many other external connectors.</p>
   <p>DCP is a memory based replication protocol that is ordering, resumable, and consistent. DCP streams changes made to documents in memory to the destination immediately. The memory based communication reduces latency and greatly boosts availability, prevents data loss, improves freshness of indexes, and more.
