  <title>Flush a bucket</title><shortdesc>This option deletes every object in a bucket.</shortdesc>
  <body>

   
      <p>Flush setting is used <b>exclusively</b> for one purpose: to enable your application to use
        the flush method and <b>delete every object in the bucket</b>. </p>
      <p>It is used very rarely, and it is highly recommended that you <b>never</b> run with this
        setting enabled in production unless you absolutely must. It can be as dangerous as it
        sounds. </p>
