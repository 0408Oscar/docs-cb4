 <title>Backup and restore</title>
 <shortdesc>Couchbase Server Enterprise Edition provides two new tools, cbbackupwrapper and cbrestorewrapper, that improve throughput for the database backup process. These tools provide a parallel processing approach to backing up a Couchbase cluster. They divide each vBucket space into a subset of vBuckets for each backup process, thus improving the speed and efficiency of the process. </shortdesc>
 <conbody>
  <note>Use the new tools instead of the standard backup tools, cbbackup and cbrestore, because the new tools address the single worker thread limitation for one backup/restore target (bucket node).</note>
  <p>For more information about these tools, see <xref href="../security/backup-restore.dita">Backup and restore</xref>. </p>
