                    <p class="p">Sub-Document API ( <em class="ph i">experimental</em>).</p>

                    <p class="p">The client-side sub-document API has been implemented. Sub-document is a
                        feature which vastly reduces network usage when operating on parts of
                        documents. The API as it appears in this version is highly experimental and
                        may (and likely will) change. Examples of use can be found in the
                        <samp class="ph codeph">examples/subdoc</samp> directory.</p>

                    scheduling an operation (e.g. <samp class="ph codeph">lcb_get3()</samp>), the scheduling
                    function will implicitly create a scheduling context and submit the operation if
                    none exists already. A scheduling context is explicitly created by calling
                    <samp class="ph codeph">lcb_sched_enter()</samp> and finished by calling
                    <samp class="ph codeph">lcb_sched_leave()</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">lcb_sched_fail()</samp>.<ul class="ul">

While API3 has been
                    promoted to stable in this version, it has been available in its current form
                    (and in a mostly compatible manner, <em class="ph i">except</em> the implicit scheduling
                    feature - CCBC-664) since 2.4.0.

            <li class="li">Fix memcached/ketama hashing. This fixes a bug in the ketama hashing code, which
					caused a key to be mapped to an effectively arbitrary server for the library
					instance. In practice, the node a key was mapped to depended on the order in
					which the hosts were specified in the connection string. This has been fixed
					always to use hashing based on the lexical sort order of each server node. It is
					highly recommended that applications upgrade to this version (2.5.5) for proper
					memcached (cache) bucket functionality.<ul class="ul">

					The old algorithm would only distribute evenly when the assumption that all

				<li class="li">Pillowfight enhancements Several behavior changes were made to pillowfight in this version.
					These are: <ul class="ul">
						<li class="li">The <samp class="ph codeph">-l</samp> or <samp class="ph codeph">-c -1</samp> option is in effect by
							default. This means that by default <samp class="ph codeph">pillowfight</samp> will
							run an infinite number of cycles. The previous behavior was to default
							to a single cycle, requiring an explicit <samp class="ph codeph">--loop</samp> to
							ensure the workload ran for a considerable amount of time. </li>

						<li class="li">When multiple threads are used, the workload is divided among the
							threads, thus making it that each thread only operates on a subset of
							the data.</li>

						<li class="li">A <samp class="ph codeph">--sequential</samp> option has been added to allow the
							workload to operate in <em class="ph i">sequence</em> on the total number of items.
							This is useful when wishing to load a bucket with many items. </li>

						<li class="li">A <samp class="ph codeph">--start-at</samp> option has been added to allow the
							workload to specify an alternate range of keys; effectively allowing
							resumption of a previous run. The <samp class="ph codeph">--start-at</samp> flag
							allows to specify the lower bound number which will be used to generate
							keys. Thus a <samp class="ph codeph">--num-items=20000</samp> and a
								<samp class="ph codeph">--start-at=10000</samp> will generate keys from 10000
							through 30000. </li>

						<li class="li">The <em class="ph i">population</em> phase has now been merged with the general
							workload implementation. This means that all worker threads will
							participate in the population phase. The previous behavior limited the
							populate phase to a single thread. </li>

						<li class="li">If <samp class="ph codeph">stdout</samp> is detected to be a terminal, a simple
							"OPS/SEC" meter will periodically write the estimated throughput to the

				<li class="li">Fix memory leak when using large read buffers In the case where large read buffers are used

				<li class="li">[major] Attempt to retry items that are mapped to a non-existent node in a degraded cluster.
					Rather than returning <samp class="ph codeph">LCB_NO_MATCHING_SERVER</samp> the behavior

						<samp class="ph codeph">LCB_RETRY_ON_MISSINGNODE</samp> which dictates how commands should

					the command until it times out, but by setting this value to <samp class="ph codeph">0</samp>
					(See <samp class="ph codeph">LCB_CNTL_RETRYMODE</samp>) it may only be attempted once, causing
					'fail fast' behavior in such a case. </li>

				<li class="li">[major] Don't throttle config requests based on initial file-based config.  This allows the client to quickly recover from a stale config cache without  waiting for the 
					<samp class="ph codeph">LCB_CNTL_CONFDELAY_THRESH</samp> interval to elapse. Prior to this  fix, a client would appear to "not recover" if bootstrapping from a stale cache.  In reality the client would eventually recover but was waiting for the delay  threshold to elapse.

				<li class="li">[major] Ignore 
					<samp class="ph codeph">NOT_MY_VBUCKET</samp> config payloads if CCCP provider is disabled.  This allows the client to circumvent any possible bugs in the CCCP response  payload and rely entirely on the HTTP config. It also allows 'rewriting'  proxies like confsed to function.

				<li class="li">[major] Add

				<li class="li">[minor] 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_get_server_list()</samp> function now returns updated information  from the current cluster configuration. Previously this would only return  a node from the list specified during initial creation.

					are: <ul class="ul">
						<li class="li">

							likely under high load. </li>

						<li class="li">

				<li class="li">[major] Provide HTTP keepalive and connection pooling for HTTP requests. This allows the

				<strong class="ph b">Changes affecting older APIs</strong>
			</p>

			<ul class="ul">
				<li class="li">[minor] Make 
					<samp class="ph codeph">run_event_loop</samp> and 
					<samp class="ph codeph">stop_event_loop</samp> private.  These functions may no longer be used from within an application to  start/stop the event loop. 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_wait()</samp> and 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_wait3()</samp> should be  used instead.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Deprecate the 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_set_XXX</samp> functions. 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_set_timeout</samp>  and some other calls have been deprecated in favor of the 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_cntl()</samp>  interface. These functions will still work but will cause the compiler  to print a deprecation warning.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[minor] 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_socket_t</samp> is typedefed to a 
					<samp class="ph codeph">DWORD</samp> on windows. In  previous versions this was an 
					<samp class="ph codeph">int</samp>.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[minor] Connecting to a standalone memcached instance is currently no longer  supported.</li>

				<li class="li">[major] 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_set_error_callback()</samp> has been deprecated. Applications should  use the new 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_set_bootstrap_callback()</samp> and/or operation callbacks  to determine success/failure status.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_get_last_error()</samp> has been deprecated. Error information is always  returned in the operation callback
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Disable the sending of 
					<samp class="ph codeph">GETQ</samp> packets. The format of this command  is cumbersome to deal with and in most uses cases is actually slightly
					<em class="ph i">less</em> efficient on the network. Note that this does not change the API  of the actual 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_get()</samp> call, but simply changes the format of the  packets sent over the wire.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] The IOPS API has been changed. This is considered volatile interface  and may subsequently change in the future as well.</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">
				<strong class="ph b">New APIs added in 2.4.0 extending existing functionality</strong>
			</p>

			<p class="p">These changes extend existing features with enhanced APIs</p>

			<ul class="ul">
				<li class="li">[major] Additional APIs for 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_cntl()</samp>. These consist of helper functions  to make it easier to use simple types or strings rather than pointers, if  possible. These functions are 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_cntl_string()</samp>, 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_cntl_setu32()</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_cntl_getu32()</samp>
				</li>

				<li class="li">[minor] Provide extended version of 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_wait()</samp>.  A new function called 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_wait3()</samp> has been added which offers additional  options with respect to running the event loop. Specifically it offers to  bypass the check for pending operations which 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_wait()</samp> executes. This  is both more performant and allows us to wait for operations which are  not explicitly scheduled.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Provide API to request a configuration refresh.  Sometimes it is necessary to force the client to request a new configuration,  for example in certain failover conditions. A new API called 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_config_refresh()</samp>  has been added, and should be used in conjunction with 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_wait3()</samp>.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Provide bootstrapping notification callback  This provides an explicit 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_set_bootstrap_callback()</samp> to definitively  determine whether the client has received its initial configuration (and  thus may now start performing operations) or whether it failed (and thus  must be reinitialized). This deprecates the common use case of
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_set_error_callback()</samp>.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] New vBucket interface/API. This API is used internally and exposed  as 
					<em class="ph i">volatile</em> inside the public header files. It provides extended features,  a more concise API, and is compatible with the upcoming Couchbase 3.0 config  format. Note that file-based configuration caches written by this version of  the library are incompatible with previous versions, however this version may  read caches generated by previous versions. This is because this version generates  a stripped-down version of the "terse" configuration style.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Extended detailed error codes.  These error codes expose more detail about the 
					<samp class="ph codeph">NETWORK_ERROR</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">CONNECT_ERROR</samp> codes returned by previous versions of the library. The extended  codes are not returned by default and must be explicitly enabled in order to  retain backwards compatibility with applications which rely on the older  error codes.
				</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">
				<strong class="ph b">New Features in 2.4.0</strong>
			</p>

			<ul class="ul">
				<li class="li">[major] Connection Strings (aka "dsn") feature for instance creation. This adds a new  version of the 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_create_st</samp> structure which is passed a URI-like string  rather than a semicolon-delimited list of hosts. This string is used to  provide options and the list of hosts that the library should connect to.  For example, 
					<samp class="ph codeph">couchbase://default/localhost&amp;compression=off</samp>
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] SSL transport support for Couchbase 3.0 Enterprise.  Couchbase 3.0 enterprise features the ability to encrypt communications  between the client and the server using the SSL protocol. SSL protocol  support in 
					<em class="ph i">libcouchbase</em>.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Retry queue for failed operations. The retry queue is used  as a place to place operations which have failed internally and which  should be retried within a certain amount of time. This also provides  options on which commands should be retried.</li>

				<li class="li">[minor] Compression/JSON flag (aka Datatype) support  This adds support for a future feature of Couchbase server which will  feature transparent compression. This feature also allows the server  to signal to the library if a document is JSON or not. The compression  feature may be disabled at compile-time, and may also be modified at  runtime by setting 
					<samp class="ph codeph">compression=off</samp> in either the connection string  or via 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_cntl_setstring(instance, "compression", "off")</samp>
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Experimental <em class="ph i">scheduling</em> API. This API replaces most of the older operation
					APIs with a scheduling API. These APIs are called with one command at a time and
					insert the resultant packet into a pipeline. The user may "schedule" the
					commands or "fail" the pipeline if a certain request has failed to be scheduled.
					This API also provides a common ABI header for commands so that they may easily
					be used via type-punning, or wrapped as a class hierarchy in C++.  This API is
					currently considered volatile but will be the basis of the upcoming libcouchbase
					3.0 API. The header file is <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;libcouchbase/api3.h&gt;</samp>
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Raw memcached packets may be sent to the library and have a callback  invoked when their responses have been received.  This adds an 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_pktfwd3()</samp> API. This requires the new scheduling API.
				</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">
				<strong class="ph b">Bug Fixes in 2.4.0</strong>
			</p>

			<ul class="ul">
				<li class="li">[major] 
					<em class="ph i">select</em> plugin may endlessly loop in some cases  The plugin may loop if there was a long timeout from the  future .
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Do not break TCP connections on topology changes unless ejected from  cluster. This ensures that nodes which are still part of the cluster have their  TCP connections remain in tact despite being shifted in their server index values.  Packets which have been sent to the wrong vBucket are silently ignored and  rescheduled to their appropriate destination. This decreases load significantly  on the client, network, and cluster during topology changes.</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Use new-style "Terse" URI format when requesting a configuration over HTTP.  This uses the HTTP configuration format over the new 
					<samp class="ph codeph">/pools/default/bs/default</samp>  rather than the older 
					<samp class="ph codeph">/pools/default/bucketsStreaming/default</samp> form. The former  form is much more efficient on the cluster side. If the new URI form is not  supported (i.e. the server responds with an HTTP 404) the older form will be  used instead. You may modify this behavior by setting the 
					<samp class="ph codeph">LCB_CNTL_HTCONFIG_URLTYPE</samp>  setting via 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_cntl()</samp>.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[minor] The 
					<samp class="ph codeph">cmake/configure</samp> script now accepts the 
					<samp class="ph codeph">LDFLAGS</samp>, 
					<samp class="ph codeph">CPPFLAGS</samp>, 
					<samp class="ph codeph">CFLAGS</samp>,
					<samp class="ph codeph">CXXFLAGS</samp>, 
					<samp class="ph codeph">CC</samp>, and 
					<samp class="ph codeph">CXX</samp> settings both within the environment 
					<em class="ph i">and</em> the  commandline, so the forms of 
					<samp class="ph codeph">CC=clang ./cmake/configure</samp> and
					<samp class="ph codeph">./cmake/configure CC=clang</samp> are equivalent.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[minor] The 
					<samp class="ph codeph">pillowfight</samp> tool will now print latencies between 1-10ms in resolutions  of 100us.
				</li>

			</ul>

			<p class="p">
				<strong class="ph b">Metadata and Packaging Changes in 2.4.0</strong>
			</p>

			<ul class="ul">
				<li class="li">[major] Use Doxygen for API documentation.  This replaces the 
					<em class="ph i">manpages</em> for API documentation with Doxygen. Doxygen  is a free and portable documentation system which may be obtained from your  distribution or at 
					<a class="xref" href="http://doxygen.org" target="_blank">http://doxygen.org</a>. To generate the documentation  from the source tree, simply run 
					<samp class="ph codeph">doxygen</samp> from the source root directory.  To generate internal documentation, run 
					<samp class="ph codeph">./docs/gen_internal_apidoc.sh</samp>.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Add interface attributes to all API calls  This properly documents all API calls with a certain API stability level  such as 
					<em class="ph i">committed</em> (for stable APIs), 
					<em class="ph i">uncomitted</em> for APIs which may, but  are not likely to change, and 
					<em class="ph i">volatile</em> for APIs which are likely to be  changed or removed.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] Public header files have been reorganized This changes the layout of the header
					files from previous versions. This should not affect applications as
					applications should only ever include the main
						<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;libcouchbase/couchbase.h&gt;</samp> file.  the following files
					have been <em class="ph i">removed</em> from the <samp class="ph codeph">&lt;libcouchbase/*&gt;</samp> header

				<li class="li">OpenSSL is now a base dependency for the library. This may be disabled at configure  time via 
					<samp class="ph codeph">--enable-ssl=no</samp>. See 
					<samp class="ph codeph">./configure --help</samp>.
				</li>

				<li class="li">Snappy compression library is bundled and optionally compiled. This is left out by  default as the configure script will search for a system installed 
					<samp class="ph codeph">libsnappy</samp>.  Snappy provides the compression feature needed for compressing and inflating data  between client and server. It may be disabled at compile-time via 
					<samp class="ph codeph">--enable-snappy=no</samp>
				</li>

				<li class="li">[minor]

			<ul class="ul">
				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-404: Segfault in 
					<samp class="ph codeph">connmgr_invoke_request</samp>  Occasionally a segmentation fault would happen when a connection was being  released as a result of a connection failure. This was because of invalid  list tracking.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-395: Add 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_cntl()</samp> interface for configuration cache  Configuration cache options may be set after instantiation using 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_cntl()</samp>  with the new 
					<samp class="ph codeph">LCB_CNTL_CONFIGCACHE</samp> operation. The old-style 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_create_compat</samp>  creation path is deprecated.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-394: Get-with-replica occasionally crashes on Windows and UV  during topology changes. This was due to not allocating a buffer if one did  not exist.</li>

				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-392: ABI compatibility broken between 2.x and 2.3 for
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_create_compat</samp>. This has been fixed by symbol aliasing between versions.  Developers are recommended to use the 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_cntl()</samp> API to set the  configuration cache, as specified in CCBC-395
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-385: Failed assertion on get-with-replica when connection fails.  If a connection fails with a 
					<samp class="ph codeph">CMD_GET_REPLICA</samp> command still in the queue an  assertion failure will crash the library. This has been fixed by handling the  opcode in the 
					<samp class="ph codeph">failout_single_request</samp> function.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-384: Unknown Winsock error codes crash application. This was fixed  by providing proper handlers for Winsock codes which were not explicitly  converted into their POSIX equivalents.</li>

				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-376: Fix memory leak in configuration parsing. A leak was  introduced in version 2.3.0 by not freeing the JSON pool structure. This has  been fixed in 2.3.1</li>

				<li class="li">[minor] CCBC-370: 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_get_host</samp> and 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_get_port</samp> may return host-port  combinations from different servers. If multiple servers are listening on  different ports this may result in yielding an invalid endpoint by combining  the output from those two functions. This has been fixed in 2.3.1 by returning  the host and port from the first host, in lieu of a currently-connected REST  endpoint.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[minor] CCBC-368: Initial bootstrapping failure may mask 
					<samp class="ph codeph">LCB_BUCKET_ENOENT</samp>  calls with 
					<samp class="ph codeph">LCB_ETIMEDOUT</samp>. This has been fixed by not retrying configuration  retrieval if an explicit HTTP 404 code is received. Note that when using  bootstrap over memcached, a missing bucket may still be manifest as
					<samp class="ph codeph">LCB_AUTH_ERROR</samp>.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[minor] CCBC-367: Ensure 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_get_host</samp> does not return 
					<samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp> when the  associated 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_t</samp> is of 
					<samp class="ph codeph">LCB_TYPE_CLUSTER</samp>. This would cause crashes in some  applications which relied on this function to not return 
					<samp class="ph codeph">NULL</samp>.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-389: Fixed Spurious timeouts being delivered in asynchronous  use cases.  In applications which do not use 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_wait()</samp> the library will potentially  time out commands internally triggering an erroneous configuration refresh.  While this issue would not end up failing operations it will cause unnecessary  network traffic for retrieving configurations. Applications using 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_wait()</samp>  are not affected as that function resets the timeout handler.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-332, CCBC-364: Compare configuration revision information  for memcached cluster bootstrap. Previously we would refresh the  configuration upon receipt  of any new configuration update from memcached. This is fixed in 2.3.1 where  the configuration will only be applied if it is deemed to be newer than the  current configuration. With memcached bootstrap this is only true if the  configuration's 
					<samp class="ph codeph">rev</samp> field is higher than the current one.

			<ul class="ul">
				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-152: Provide a master-only observe option. This adds a new  struct version to the 
					<samp class="ph codeph">lcb_observe_cmd_t</samp> which allows to select only the  master node. One can use this to efficiently check if the key exists (without  retrieving it). It also allows one to get the CAS of the item without fetching  it.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-281: Fix partial scheduling during multi operations. Previously  the library would deliver spurious callbacks  if multiple operations were  scheduled with a single command and one of the operations could not be mapped  to a server. This fixes this behavior and ensures that callbacks are only  invoked for items if the entire API call succeeded.</li>

				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-150: Multi-packet commands will no longer deliver spurious  callbacks on failure. Previously these commands would be relocated to the  same server during a configuration change, resulting in multiple callbacks  for the same command. In this case the client would think all the commands  had been completed, and when the next response arrived it would incorrectly  map it to a different request.</li>

				<li class="li">[minor] CCBC-327: Fix assumption of 
					<samp class="ph codeph">vbucket_compare()</samp> only returning if  a diff exists. This function actually returns a non-NULL pointer always  unless it cannot allocate more memory. This bug was introduced with the
					<em class="ph i">DP1</em> release.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[minor] CCBC-326: Memcached buckets should use streaming config. This was  left unchecked in the 
					<em class="ph i">DP1</em> release and has now been fixed.
				</li>

				<li class="li">[major] CCBC-234: Implementation of[Cluster Configuration Carrier Publication][cccp-wiki].
					This is the new and more efficient way to bootstrap from a cluster using the
					native memcached protocol and is quicker than the previous HTTP bootstrap
					mechanism, dramatically improving startup times and reducing load on the server.
					This feature is available in server verions 2.5 and greater. The existing HTTP
					configuration is still supported and will be employed as a fallback in the event
					that <samp class="ph codeph">CCCP</samp> is not supported.  In conjunction with this, a new
					struct version has been added to the <samp class="ph codeph">lcb_create_st</samp> parameters
					structure for use with <samp class="ph codeph">lcb_create</samp>. This allows you to get more
					control over how the client is initialized: <pre class="pre codeblock">lcb_t instance;
struct lcb_create_st options;
lcb_config_transport_t enabled_transports = {
    LCB_CONFIG_TRANSPORT_CCCP,
    LCB_CONFIG_TRANSPORT_LIST_END
};</pre>

					<pre class="pre codeblock">memset(&amp;options, 0, sizeof(options));
options.version = 2;
options.v.v2.mchosts = "example.com:11210";
options.v.v2.transports = enabled_transports;</pre>

					<pre class="pre codeblock">lcb_error_t rc = lcb_create(&amp;instance, &amp;options);

}</pre>

					The above snippet will configure a client to <em class="ph i">always</em> use the
						<samp class="ph codeph">CCCP</samp> protocol and never attempt to fall back on HTTP  The
					CCCP implementation required a significant rewrite in how sockets were created
					and re-used. Particularly, a connection pooling feature was implemented.

						<samp class="ph codeph">-C</samp> option which accepts the preferred configuration

					to a positive integer -- the higher the number the more verbose the logging).
					Integrators may also use the logging API specified in
						<samp class="ph codeph">&lt;libcouchbase/types.h&gt;</samp> to proxy the library's logging
					messages into your own application.  Current events logged include connection

This allows  you to "group" items together in your cluster. A typical use case  for this is if you're storing lets say data for a single user in  multiple objects. If you want to ensure that either all or none of  the objects are available if a server goes down, it could be a good  idea to locate them on the same server. Do bear in mind that if you  do try to decide where objects is located, you may end up with an  uneven distribution of the number of items on each node. This will  again result in some nodes being more busy than others etc. This is  why some clients doesn't allow you to do this, so bear in mind that  by doing so you might not be able to get your objects from other  clients.</li>

				<li class="li">CCBC-38 Use alternate nodes when current is dead. A fix to allow the  client library to failover automatically to other nodes when the  initial bootstrap node becomes unavailable has been added. All users  are recommended to upgrade for this fix.</li>

				<li class="li">Fix connect timeouts. Timeouts are per-operation and only set if  there is any I/O. The special exception to this is initial  connections, which do not necessarily have a data stream or write  buffer associated wiht them yet.</li>

				<li class="li">Fixed segfaults and memory access errors on libevent1.4</li>

					<samp class="ph codeph">stop_event_loop</samp> and libcouchbase maybe breakout work  properly in cooperative asynchronous event loops. the wait flag is  set by 
					<samp class="ph codeph">libcouchbase_wait()</samp> and unset by

				<li class="li">Refactor: use

				<li class="li">Do not notify user about the same error twice. Use command callback  when it's possible. (e.g. where the

				<li class="li">Install configuration.h for win32</li>

				<li class="li">CCBC-20 Implement operation timeouts. Timeouts applies for all  operations, and the timer starts running from the moment you call  the libcouchbase operation you want. The timer includes times for  connect/send/ receive, and all of the time our application spend  before letting the event loop call callbacks into libcouchbase.</li>
