### HTML ID tags
All major content within the documentation should be annotated with ID tags to allow linking to specific sections of content within the documentation.  These ID tags should match the title of the section, they must use alpha-numeric lower-case characters only and any spaces must be replaced with underscores.

### Code Samples
Inclusion of code samples is an important aspect of our documentation.  Code-samples within our documentation should be commited to the devguide-examples repository, and then the same code should be included within the documentation directly as a code block.  These code-blocks should have a comment on the first line indicating the source of the code (in the format of a link to the specific file and lines on github).
